 Problem Statement:- Blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum face
 challenges regarding transaction throughput and latency due to the consensus
 mechanism. This mechanism requires agreement among all peers in the network,
 leading to slower transaction processing times and limited scalability.

 
 Objective:- The objective of this project is to implement and enhance the existing
 routing protocol, as proposed in the paper "MPCN-RP: A Routing Protocol for
 Blockchain-Based Multi-Charge Payment Channel Networks." We aim to achieve
 this by first implementing the existing routing algorithm and then enhancing it by
 incorporating a mechanism to prioritize nodes with a higher success rate in
 transaction forwarding. Additionally, we will conduct a comprehensive
 performance evaluation to analyze the communication overhead and computational
 costs associated with the proposed enhancements.
